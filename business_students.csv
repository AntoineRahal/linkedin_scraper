I was fascinated by how I could give hope to people just by wearing a t-shirt and 3 years later, at the age of 19, I started my first venture - T-shirts with positive quotes. 3 months later, we realised that 95% of our sales were generated by businesses from customised products than by retail customers. As a teenager, I experienced profits, bookkeeping, sales, losses and revenues and that's when I knew what I wanted to do in life.

After my graduation, at the age of 21, I launched my own menswear retail store with few savings and some help from my family. Coming from a non-business background, I was on the streets knocking doors, networking and visiting exhibitions, collecting data not just theoritically but also practically and that's where I realised how the actual market works. During this time, I researched extensively to bring out the best for my store by visiting over 500+ suppliers and being the first in the local market to offer sustainable products. 

Later, we switched the model from retail to wholesale, and we implemented few of the retail strategies in our B2B business. This led to an incremental growth in our B2B business and we served to various prominent clients like KPMG, IBM, Northeastern University, Marrakesh and catered to clients in 5 different countries. In fact,, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we were one of the very few companies to be profitable since we started catering to the covid-19 warriors by providing PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) gears, masks and sanitizers.

I am passionate in the commercial analysis and thinking about the new commercial modes. 

I have achieved the excellent performance on the specialized courses, and have a comprehensive understanding to the macro-environment of financial market through the extracurricular supplementary studying and practice. 

I have great adaptability in the work environment because of rich experience in the business. I started entrepreneurship from the high school, I founded Shangyuan Technology Co., Ltd. that provided the films and television services for the governments and enterprises, as well as provided the unmanned aerial vehicle solutions for the relevant departments (such as agriculture, power system, fire fighting, public security).

Nene Afadzinu,Business Administration Student,"Accra, Greater Accra, Ghana",500+,"Bachelor of Science - BS, Business Administration and Management, General",Ashesi University,"['English', 'French', 'Ga']","I am a goal-oriented prospective technical director who strives to make an impact on the world of football and especially on the continent of Africa. I have recently completed the FA Playmaker and FA Level 1 in Talent Identification courses and am looking forward to expanding my knowledge with subsequent courses. I am always willing to learn from everyone around me, with the belief that every human has an experience to share and value to add.

The beautiful game of football has taught me many life lessons as well. Its taught me to be patient because good things come to those who wait. I must not be impetuous in seeking ways to improve my situation because I may not only save time in being patient, but may also save money. In the end, I will end up producing much better results. 

It has encouraged me to pass it around (teamwork)- a 50 pence word which is perhaps more than a billion times worth its weight in gold. One of the most under-appreciated values in modern society. Individual ability may get me the kayak, but teamwork will row me across the raging rapids of life. 

I have learnt from football, that when life hands you lemons, make lemonade. Be ready for any situation. Things may not always go the way you expect them to and when they don't, handle yourself with class and èlan and think about the best solution for your problem. 

As clichèd as this may sound, it has also taught me that all that glitters is not gold and that though it is true that I must not be quick to assume the best of people, but neither must I be quick to assume the worst of them. That, even if willing to take risks in life those risks must be calculated and that I must not be impetuous in going in for the most attractive option. One must also never underestimate an opponent or take people for granted. 

Another key lesson I have imbibed from my love and pursuit of football is what I call P.O.P (Potential Over Proven) - one should invest in long term joy in place of short term happiness and prepare for every situation with an eye on the future. Today lasts for only 24 hours. Tomorrow lasts for eternity. 

The stories of teams like Zambia 2012, Greece 2004 and Leicester City 2015/16 shows that anything is possible if I believe and that I should never give up. These principles guide me towards my life goals."

I am currently a Senior at the Pennsylvania State University, on the path to obtain a Bachelor's degree in Management and Spanish and a minor in International Business. 

I realized that I always took the lead in a group project and enjoyed being able to make a difference in people's lives by helping them with their day to day problems which persuaded me to take a step back and look at my skills. I enjoy solving problems, taking positions of leadership, and completing tasks in an organized and timely manner. Because of my abilities to complete tasks independently and apply leadership tactics, I realized that a career in the management field was the perfect path for me. I am a hard working, diligent, and determined person which will allow me to excel in any career with this general field.

Also, throughout my childhood, I was fortunate enough to obtain many cultural experiences from a very young age. My family traveled often which sparked my interests in the world of international business. I was particularly drawn to both the language and culture when visiting Spain. Additionally, my mother was born and raised in Argentina and often spoke to me around the house in Spanish. Because of this, I excelled in picking up the language throughout classes and decided to pursue it in college. The ability to communicate with a different culture in a unique ways is extremely rewarding and a passion of mine.

I have had two internship opportunities, one in the legal department at St. Luke's University Health Network, and the other at Computer Aid, Inc. in the HR department. These two experiences solidified my desire to work in an area that I can help others and take on a position of leadership. They both contributed to my experience in the fields of teamwork and cooperation as well. 

When I'm not learning or working, I enjoy playing volleyball, spending time with my family and friends, partaking in club activities, going on walks with my dogs and traveling the world."
