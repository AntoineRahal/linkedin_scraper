I am always willing to learn from everyone around me, with the belief that every human has an experience to share and value to add.\n",

In the end, I will end up producing much better results. \n",

      "\n",
      "As clichèd as this may sound, it has also taught me that all that glitters is not gold and that though it is true that I must not be quick to assume the best of people, but neither must I be quick to assume the worst of them. That, even if willing to take risks in life those risks must be calculated and that I must not be impetuous in going in for the most attractive option. One must also never underestimate an opponent or take people for granted. \n",

      "Another key lesson I have imbibed from my love and pursuit of football is what I call P.O.P (Potential Over Proven) - one should invest in long term joy in place of short term happiness and prepare for every situation with an eye on the future. Today lasts for only 24 hours. Tomorrow lasts for eternity. \n",

Learning something new everyday when meeting with new people and hearing their viewpoint. Learning never stops in life, there is so much more to learn and grow and I will keep on going!\n",
